# rust_ge

This is a Rust game engine based off/inspired by the C++ game engine [ge211](https://github.com/tov/ge211), 
originally developed by [Jesse Tov](https://github.com/tov).  

The engine is still in active development and holds no guarantee of working.

*This was originally created as a project for the course "CS 396/496: Systems Programming in Rust" at Northwestern University*
