//! Welcome to the rust_ge documentation!
//!
//! `rust_ge` is a simple game engine built around SDL2
//! using the [rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) crate and based off the
//! [ge211](https://github.com/tov/ge211) game engine developed by Jesse Tov.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Both the library and documentation are still a work in progress, so don't be surprised if
//! something doesn't work
//!
